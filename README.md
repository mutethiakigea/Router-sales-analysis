Data Dictionary and Strategy Document
Overview
This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the datasets provided (Customers, Orders, Router_Info) and the approach taken to analyze these datasets in relation to PRIMEZâ€™s concerns regarding consistent returns of a specific internet modem.

Data Files
Customers: Contains information about PRIMEZ's customers, including unique identifiers, demographics, and contact details.
Orders: Holds details about the orders made by customers, such as order IDs, product IDs, quantities, prices, and dates.
Router_Info: Provides specifics about the internet modems sold by PRIMEZ, including modem IDs, specifications, and any other relevant attributes.

Data Strategy
Analysis Objective
The primary goal is to identify patterns or factors contributing to the consistent returns of a specific internet modem within the PRIMEZ dataset. This involves:

Examining return rates specifically linked to the modem's product ID.
Analyzing customer demographics (age, gender, location) associated with return instances.
Evaluating any correlations between the specifications of the modem and return rates.
Approach
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Identifying and handling missing or erroneous data.
Standardizing data formats and handling outliers if present.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing return rates for the specific modem against time, customer demographics, and other relevant factors.
Analyzing correlations between modem specifications and return rates.
Hypothesis Testing:
Formulating hypotheses based on EDA insights and testing them rigorously.
Recommendations:
Providing actionable recommendations based on findings to mitigate return rates or enhance product satisfaction.
Deliverables
Visualizations illustrating return patterns.
Statistical analyses supporting hypotheses.
Recommendations backed by data insights.
This README file outlines the data dictionary for each dataset and the strategy employed to address PRIMEZ's concern regarding the consistently returned internet modem.
